# MSFT Stock Price Prediction with LSTM

This project uses an LSTM neural network to predict Microsoft (MSFT) stock prices with historical data from Yahoo Finance.

## Features
- Fetches MSFT stock data (2015-2025).
- Trains an LSTM model to predict stock prices.
- Evaluates predictions with RMSE.
- Plots historical predictions, training loss, and 30-day future forecasts.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `yfinance`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`

## Installation
1. Clone the repo:
